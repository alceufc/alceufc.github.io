    <p>
    I am Alceu Costa, a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of
    SÃ£o Paulo (USP) in Brazil.
    Part of my ongoing PhD project included a visiting period of one year at
    Carnegie Mellon University.
    Currently, I am researching data mining techniques to detect bots and
    fraudsters on social media based on temporal data.
    I am also working on modeling information cascades and user communication
    behavior.
