# About Me

I am Alceu Costa, a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of
SÃ£o Paulo (USP) in Brazil.
Part of my ongoing PhD project included a visiting period of one year at
Carnegie Mellon University.
Currently, I am researching data mining techniques to detect bots and
fraudsters on social media based on temporal data.
I am also working on modeling information cascades and user communication
behavior.

My research interests include:

 - Data mining (KDD);
 - Modeling user behavior in social media;
 - Image processing and computer vision;

I also like to [take photos](http://www.flickr.com/photos/9342060@N05/) on my
free time.
